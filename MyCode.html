            <h1>My Code/About the Project</h1>
            <p><br> All of my code can be found at my public GitHub Repository, which's comments and commits explain what is happening very well.<br> The 2 files that partain to the project are "source.py" and "Complete.py", as the rest are for this website.<br>
            </p>

            <p><br> Don't Slouch Online was inspired by myself, and those around me, as I am constantly told to not slouch by many people. <br><br> Since I am a programmer, I thought, "Wait, code can do anything!". So I set out to create<br> an application
                that would stop me from slouching.<br> <br> <br> I have been testing my app for a few hours, and I can say that I've seen a major difference in my posture. <br> Here is the link to a my video on the project. <br><br>
